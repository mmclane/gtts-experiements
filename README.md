# gTTS experiements

I was just playing with some text to speach ideas.  gTTS should fairly good compared to others like espeake.


## Prereques

Install mplayer
- sudo apt-get install mplayer -y

Install requirements
- pip install -r requirements.txt

## Use

You can change the text that will get read on line 1
You can change the language and accent on line 6

Running this creates a mp3 that is then played via mplayer.  This could be customized further if needed.
